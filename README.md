* The main purpose of this library was to upload pictures from ESP32-CAM to a website making the picture available on a http url, as seen here [https://github.com/ldab/ESP32-CAM-Picture-Sharing](https://github.com/ldab/ESP32-CAM-Picture-Sharing), making it usuable on `Blynk` or on your webiste.

## TODO

[ ] - List Dir contents test with different serves;
[ ] - Implement download;

* For the uploading example we will use the GitHub Octocat, which binary file is [here](./src/octocat.h):
