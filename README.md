# FTP Client for the ESP32
An FTP-Client for the ESP32

At the moment it is only possible to upload data via FTP, because
this was my main usecase.
I used this client to write sensordata into a log file and to upload
images for my rabbit-webcam.

You can create files or append data to files on your FTP-Server.
